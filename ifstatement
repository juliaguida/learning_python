How to create an if statement:

If statement

if <expr>:
    <statement(s)>
else:
    <statement(s)>

Python follows the off-side rule to indicate when the function block finishes,
 by the position of the last statement. A control flow in python will have the following:
An if statement, a : in the end of the statement, comparison,

name = input('what is your name')
if name >= 'Julia':
   print('Hi Julia')
else:
   print('Sorry! you are not Julia')
