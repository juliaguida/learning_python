# Here is a problem for you to breakdown into smaller problems and work on the logic side, it is ok if you dont get to the code:
# Shopping cart app: Write a program that keeps taking shopping items as inputs from the user and adds it to a shopping cart until the user inputs 'pay' as an input and then print the list of items in the shopping cart as a list.
# Pick a program from the kata and do the same.

# Logic:
# Keywords: keep taking - for loop or while Loops
# shopping_items = input()
# add it to a shopping_cart # a append()method
# until the user inputs 'pay'# if stament with a for loop condition to when the user says pay it calculate the total of the  shooping_cart

# print() # to display the shopping items available to buy
# shopping_list_input()
# empty_lis[] # to store the user input
# for or while loop ? # to itenerate through the items input by  the users.
